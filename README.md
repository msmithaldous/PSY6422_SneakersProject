# PSY6422_SneakersProject
This project is based on the world of Sneaker resale, in particular on the reselling platform StockX. I have a keen interest in fashion and sneakers in particular so this topic seemed like an easy choice for me. The visualisations in the project compare the resale value of Yeezy and Off-White sneakers in comparison with their original retail value, ultimately identfiying the most profitable sneaker. A further visualisation assesses and compares the resell value of Yeezy or Off-White sneakers across the years 2017,2018 and 2019. 

The specific research questions i wanted to investigate during my project are -
* Which Sneaker brand can be sold for the highest profit margin?
* When was it most beneficial to resell a sneaker of either Off-white or Yeezy in order to maximize profits?

I retrieved the data used in this project from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest). The data includes input from the online Sneaker reselling site, [StockX](https://stockx.com). A website commonly used in order to buy and sell Sneakers that are sold out in retail stores, often at an inflated price; dependent on the sneakers exclusivity. The data focuses on two different brands, Off-White collaborations with Nike & Yeezy (produced by Adidas). Due to [StockX](https://stockx.com) being a reselling site, the data set also includes the price in which each sneaker was sold at retail price (in USD- $) through the Nike/Adidas websites, in addition to their sale price on [StockX](https://stockx.com). All data was collected between 01/09/2017- 13/02/2019, consisting of 99956 entries. Finally the data set specifies in which US state the sneakers were purchased at resale price in and which size they purchased in (US Mens).
